Info. Tools App Design Unit

## Why are we learning how to design apps in Info. Tools?

In Info. Tools, our goal is to learn how to use technology more effeciently and effectively. A major part of effective use of technology is being able to navigate new types of apps and programs (that is, new types of interfaces) successfuly. By studying how apps are designed and designing a few interfaces of our own, we are exploring the fundamental building blocks of our interactions with technology and gaining a greater understanding of how to approach new technologies in the future. 

    Technology - both in terms of apps and devices - is changing with such rapidity these days that studying a certain program (like Apple's Pages or Microsoft Excel) does not make sense. Students need to be equipped to quickly navigate and utalize any interface they may come accross during their educational career. Our focus on the design, rather than the nuainces of how to use certain features or functions of an app, allows us to better build the skills to tackle problems using any manner of technology.

## Part One: Introduction to App Design

We start the unit by talking about the differences between design and development. 

- **Designing** an app entails creating the concept of the app, determining what the user will use the app to do or make, deciding on the features of the app, and outlining how users will interact with the app.

- **Developing** an app is the process of taking an app design and turning it into a fully functioning application, one that is ready to be delivered to users. 

This introduction is meant to make sure everyone understood we would be conceptualizing, not developing, a full app. 

We also discuss the design process and break this process down into three core steps. 

1. Needfinding
2. Prototyping
3. Usability Testing

At the end of class, the students fill in a survey about what apps they use most frequently, what they find useful or enjoyable about these apps, and what they think could be improved. The survey is intended to help students start thinking critcally about how apps function and what makes certain apps better than others.

## Part Two: App Design Basics and Initial App Ideas

In the next session, we jump into the first part of the app design process - Needfinding. Before we start coming up with app concepts, however, we cover a few of the basic elements found in all apps. 

- **Navigation**
- **Information**

We catagorize all forms and functions within an app as falling under either Navigation or Information. This provides an easy way to frame important questions about our own app ideas.

- How do users move around and interact with my app?
- What do users see, create, or do with my app?
- What is the data displayed or stored by my app?

Our assignment for the period is to come up with the concept for an app. (It has to be a concept for an iPad app, since that is the device we all have in common. It could be a game, but students are urged away from game ideas due to the often complicated nature of their interactions). Each student submits one app idea with a name, short descritpion, and also a list of three apps on the App Store similar to their idea.

## Part Three: Pitch Day and Class Voting

The third session of this unit is pitch day. Students take the ideas they came up with in the second session and present them to the class. These presentations need not be long, one to two minutes tops per student. 

Presntations are then followed by voting on the app ideas. The students should vote for their top three choices, but should not vote for their own idea.
