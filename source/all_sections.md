Info. Tools App Design Unit

## Why are we learning how to design apps in Info. Tools?

In Info. Tools, our goal is to learn how to use technology more efficiently and effectively. A major part of effective use of technology is being able to navigate new types of apps and programs (that is, new types of interfaces) successfully. By studying how apps are designed and designing a few interfaces of our own, we are exploring the fundamental building blocks of our interactions with technology and gaining a greater understanding of how to approach new technologies in the future. 

    Technology - both in terms of apps and devices - is changing with such rapidity these days that studying a certain program (like Apple's Pages or Microsoft Excel) does not make sense. Students need to be equipped to quickly navigate and utilize any interface they may come across during their educational career. Our focus on the design, rather than the nuances of how to use certain features or functions of an app, allows us to better build the skills to tackle problems using any manner of technology.

## Part One: An Overview of App Design

We start the unit by talking about the differences between design and development. 

-**Designing** an app entails creating the concept of the app, determining what the user will use the app to do or make, deciding on the features of the app, and outlining how users will interact with the app.

-**Developing** an app is the process of taking an app design and turning it into a fully functioning application, one that is ready to be delivered to users. 

This introduction is meant to make sure everyone understands we will be conceptualizing, not developing, a full app. 

We also discuss the design process and break this process down into three core steps. 

1. Needfinding

2. Prototyping

3. Usability Testing

At the end of this class, the students fill in a survey about what apps they use most frequently, what they find useful or enjoyable about these apps, and what they think could be improved. The survey is intended to help students start thinking critically about how apps function and what makes certain apps better than others.

## Part Two: App Design Basics and Initial App Ideas

In the next session, we jump into the first part of the app design process - Needfinding. Before we start coming up with app concepts, however, we cover a few of the basic elements found in all apps. 

- **Navigation**  - menus, links, buttons

- **Information** - text, photos, posts

We categorize all forms and functions within an app as falling under either Navigation or Information. This provides an easy way to frame important questions about our own app ideas.

- How do users move around and interact with my app?

- How to can I make using this app as simple and easy as possible?

- What do users see, create, or do with my app?

- What is the data displayed or stored by my app?

Our assignment for the period is to come up with the concept for an app. It has to be a concept for an iPad app, since that is the device we all have in common. It could be a game, but students are urged away from game ideas due to the often complicated nature of their interactions. Each student submits one app idea with a name, short description, and also a list of three apps on the App Store similar to their idea.

## Part Three: Pitch Day and Class Voting

The third session of this unit is pitch day. Students take the ideas they came up with in the second session and present them to the class. These presentations need not be long, one to two minutes tops per student. 

Presentations are then followed by voting on the app ideas. The students should vote for their top three choices, but should not vote for their own idea. 

The votes will be used to determine the best app ideas in the class. We will then split into groups based on the winning apps, with no more than 3 - 4 students per group.

## Part Four: First Design Day

The next step is to begin fleshing out our design ideas. We start by forming into our groups, then taking a few minutes to write out an *Application Definition Statement* (ADS) that succulently states the nature of our app - the problem it solves and the users it targets. This ADS provides a point of reference for all group members to keep them focused on the overall goals of the app during the design process. 

On this day, we introduce a handful of fundamental concepts related to design.

1. **Proximity** - spatial/visual proximity implies a meaningful relationship between items (text, buttons, etc.)

2. **Visibility** - the size and visual styling of items can be used to guide the user's eye and actions 

3. **Consistency** - the related items in an interface should be located and styled in a similar manner

We also discuss Hick's Law briefly, which is a useful idea to keep in mind when designing an interface. 

**Hick's Law**: The more choices given to a user, the longer it takes for a user to select one

We then look at a few example wireframes and then dive into the process of developing our own in the assigned groups. 

Our first step toward creating wireframes of our apps is to sketch our ideas out on paper. Sketching on paper is the best way to test out any kind of design idea - it is fast, efficient, and allows all members of the group to actively participate in the design process. We will be doing a ton of sketching during this unit as we employ an iterative approach to designing our interfaces.

## Part Five: An Aside on Copyright

In the middle of this unit, we take a brief repose from our design work to talk about copyright. This is a very relevant time for this topic, as it helps students understand what they can include in their app ideas. 

## Part Six: Creating Prototypes

For our sixth class, we take on the design principle of Affordance. 

1. **Affordance** - make it easy for the user to do the right thing, while also making it hard for them to do the wrong thing. 

This year, we are using the wildly popular [Flappy Bird]() as our example of how app designers must make their apps simple to use. In terms of Affordance, Flappy Bird makes it blindingly simple to do the right thing (keep playing Flappy Bird) and hard to do the wrong thing (stop playing and/or talking about Flappy Bird). This example also provides a perfect opportunity for talking about how successful apps are built to be used constantly and without friction. 

We also spend time sketching out our ideas into more fully formed prototypes. Using the [POP app]() we can turn our sketches into a usable prototype of our idea. This part of the unit may last for longer than just one class session, as creating a prototype on POP that works well is fundamental to the next step in the process.
