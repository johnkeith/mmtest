## Part Two: App Design Basics and Initial App Ideas

In the next session, we jump into the first part of the app design process - Needfinding. Before we start coming up with app concepts, however, we cover a few of the basic elements found in all apps. 

- **Navigation**  - menus, links, buttons

- **Information** - text, photos, posts

We categorize all forms and functions within an app as falling under either Navigation or Information. This provides an easy way to frame important questions about our own app ideas.

- How do users move around and interact with my app?

- How to can I make using this app as simple and easy as possible?

- What do users see, create, or do with my app?

- What is the data displayed or stored by my app?

Our assignment for the period is to come up with the concept for an app. It has to be a concept for an iPad app, since that is the device we all have in common. It could be a game, but students are urged away from game ideas due to the often complicated nature of their interactions. Each student submits one app idea with a name, short description, and also a list of three apps on the App Store similar to their idea.
