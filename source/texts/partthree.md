## Part Three: Pitch Day and Class Voting

The third session of this unit is pitch day. Students take the ideas they came up with in the second session and present them to the class. These presentations need not be long, one to two minutes tops per student. 

Presentations are then followed by voting on the app ideas. The students should vote for their top three choices, but should not vote for their own idea. 

The votes will be used to determine the best app ideas in the class. We will then split into groups based on the winning apps, with no more than 3 - 4 students per group.
