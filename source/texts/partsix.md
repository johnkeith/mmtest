## Part Six: Creating Prototypes

For our sixth class, we take on the design principle of Affordance. 

1. **Affordance** - make it easy for the user to do the right thing, while also making it hard for them to do the wrong thing. 

This year, we are using the wildly popular [Flappy Bird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) as our example of how app designers must make their apps simple to use. In terms of Affordance, Flappy Bird makes it blindingly simple to do the right thing (keep playing Flappy Bird) and hard to do the wrong thing (stop playing and/or talking about Flappy Bird). This example also provides a perfect opportunity for talking about how successful apps are built to be used constantly and without friction. 

We also spend time sketching out our ideas into more fully formed prototypes. Using the [POP app](https://popapp.in/) we can turn our sketches into a usable prototype of our idea. This part of the unit may last for longer than just one class session, as creating a prototype on POP that works well is fundamental to the next step in the process.
