## Part Four: First Design Day

The next step is to begin fleshing out our design ideas. We start by forming into our groups, then taking a few minutes to write out an *Application Definition Statement* (ADS) that succulently states the nature of our app - the problem it solves and the users it targets. This ADS provides a point of reference for all group members to keep them focused on the overall goals of the app during the design process. 

On this day, we introduce a handful of fundamental concepts related to design.

1. **Proximity** - spatial/visual proximity implies a meaningful relationship between items (text, buttons, etc.)

2. **Visibility** - the size and visual styling of items can be used to guide the user's eye and actions 

3. **Consistency** - the related items in an interface should be located and styled in a similar manner

We also discuss Hick's Law briefly, which is a useful idea to keep in mind when designing an interface. 

**Hick's Law**: The more choices given to a user, the longer it takes for a user to select one

We then look at a few example wireframes and then dive into the process of developing our own in the assigned groups. 

Our first step toward creating wireframes of our apps is to sketch our ideas out on paper. Sketching on paper is the best way to test out any kind of design idea - it is fast, efficient, and allows all members of the group to actively participate in the design process. We will be doing a ton of sketching during this unit as we employ an iterative approach to designing our interfaces.
