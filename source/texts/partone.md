## Part One: An Overview of App Design

We start the unit by talking about the differences between design and development. 

- **Designing** an app entails creating the concept of the app, determining what the user will use the app to do or make, deciding on the features of the app, and outlining how users will interact with the app.

- **Developing** an app is the process of taking an app design and turning it into a fully functioning application, one that is ready to be delivered to users. 

This introduction is meant to make sure everyone understands we will be conceptualizing, not developing, a full app. 

We also discuss the design process and break this process down into three core steps. 

1. Needfinding

2. Prototyping

3. Usability Testing

At the end of this class, the students fill in a survey about what apps they use most frequently, what they find useful or enjoyable about these apps, and what they think could be improved. The survey is intended to help students start thinking critically about how apps function and what makes certain apps better than others.
